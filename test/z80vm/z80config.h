/* The emulator cannot be stopped between prefixed opcodes. This can be a

 * least numbers_cycles are executed, in which case Z80_STATE's status is set 
 * to Z80_STATUS_PREFIX. Note that if the memory where the opcodes are read, 
 * has wait states (slow memory), then the additional cycles for a one byte 
 * fetch (the non executed prefix) must be substracted. Even if it is safer, 
 * most program won't need this feature.

/* For interrupt mode 2, bit 0 of the 16-bit address to the interrupt vector 
 * can be masked to zero. Some documentation states that this bit is forced to 
 * zero. For instance, Zilog's application note about interrupts, states that
 * "only 7 bits are required" and "the least significant bit is zero". Yet, 
 * this is quite unclear, even from Zilog's manuals. So this is left as an 
 * option.
